# grocery_app

This is a Grocery app that I thought of one lazy afternoon.  
Initially, I just had a basic concept like multiple users adding products to a common list, 
so that when a person is shopping, they can refer to it.  
It would be best suited for families or roommates who have to communicate a lot in terms of what groceries they want, 
individually or collectively.  However, by the time I actually finished designing this, 
the whole concept had ballooned into something complex and with multiple use cases. 
I would definitely explore it further and add more screens or content around it soon.
